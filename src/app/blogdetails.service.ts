      blogDetails:"Written in our stars”, that’s how Aastha and Rachit described their story. Even when they did not realise it, they were meant to be Aastha and Rachit have known each other their whole lives. The more time they spent with each other, the more they realised that they were ‘it’. They brought out the best in the other and became the “go-to person” for each other.They married each other in a beautiful two-day celebration at the Westin Sohna. Here are a few of our favourite moments from their festivities. Part 1: Welcome Lunch The wedding celebrations began with a casual lunch that was the perfect start to the upcoming festivities. It was a lovely winter afternoon where friends and family got together. We sneaked our lovely couple out for a few portraits before the hustle-bustle of the wedding began. It was the perfect time for us to spend some time with the couple as well as for them to spend some quiet uninterrupted moments with each other!",

      blogDetails:"Alisha and Naman are a firecracker of a couple. Always ready for adventure and more! So when they told us they wanted a pre-wedding that was everything – dreamy, fun and fairytale-ish – we were excited! With a couple like them, we knew we had the opportunity to have a lot of fun while making images we love.We decided to do it in the Neemrana Kesroli Fort. It’s a small but extremely charming fort and it was the perfect place to give our couple their dream.Having already shot their Proposal and Engagement ceremony before, meeting them was like seeing old friends. We started their first session early in the morning at 6. Well, 4 am for Alisha because she had to get up even earlier to get ready! There are fields all around the fort, so we decided it might be fun to go down and shoot in one of them with the morning sun. It’s a bit of a walk from the fort, so we’re sure the people who lived around were wondering what a group of people with cameras and a dressed-up couple were doing in the fields so early in the morning!",

      blogDetails:"Rashmi and Krishna came to us with this idea of an epic pre-wedding. They wanted it to be beautiful, dreamy and grand. And they were up for anything to make it memorable. After much research, we decided that the Andaman and Nicobar Islands would be the perfect place to make this happen for them. And we were right.It turned out to be one of our most memorable pre-wedding shoots with the most adventurous and fearless couple. We did everything that we dreamed of during this shoot and Rashmi and Krishna were supportive and enthusiastic throughout – from getting up at 2 in the morning to staying calm in the water when there were snakes around!We were also scheduled to shoot Rashmi and Krishna’s wedding a few months later. So it was even more exciting for us to spend some time together with the couple before the rush of wedding festivities began. Here are some of our favourite images from their much-loved pre-wedding session in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.",

      blogName:"A Intimate Home Wedding in Delhi with 16 Guests",
      blogDetails:"A proposal in the hills and an intimate wedding ceremony at home – everything about Dakshaa and Rishabh’s story warms our hearts. There’s nothing better than being a part of the story of two amazing people in love. Throw in a pandemic and a small home wedding with 16 guests – and we’re more than game!Dakshaa and Rishabh were originally scheduled to have a somewhat larger wedding in Delhi with a larger gathering of guests and extended family. When the pandemic struck, nobody really knew what to do and we were more than happy to help the couple the best we could and agreed to wait and watch. However, much to our excitement, the couple decided that #loveovercomes, and decided to go ahead with the wedding with just 16 “must-have” guests, which included their parents, siblings and Naila, their beautiful 4-year old golden Labrador. It was a real privilege to shoot a wedding so intimate and personal that it easily turned out to be one of the most rewarding experiences for us. It’s reaffirmed something we’ve always said – it’s not about the size of the wedding, but about who you have around you and how much you enjoy the day.",
